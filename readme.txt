Total videos were compressed for github, and replit has less storage for development, so I could compress total videos, resulting in lower video resolution and audio.Â 

I apologise for the typos in the video. I fixed typos in the code.

I changed some words on this website for a new look.

* The Youtube title is replaced with Video Tittle in smplayit website.

* The Youtube description is changed with Video Description in smplayit website

* The Youtube thumbnail is changed with Video Thumbline in smplayit website
